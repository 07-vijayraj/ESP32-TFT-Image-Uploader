# ESP32-TFT-Image-Uploader
This project displays any image on a TFT display directly from a laptop. First, the image is converted from JPG to BMP using Paint. Then, a Python script converts the BMP image into RGB565 format. Finally, the RGB565 data is uploaded to the TFT display using CoolTerm over serial communication.
